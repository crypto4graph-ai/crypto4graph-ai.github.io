## Project Overview and Objectives

This project initiates the development of CRYPTO4GRAPH-AI, a scalable, secure, and privacy-friendly
framework for the intelligent management and analysis of graph data within and across enterprises and
other organizations. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained increasing adoption and popularity in the
enterprise environment due to their ability to integrate data, rich domain knowledge, and metadata from
heterogeneous sources [WBdB17]. Despite significant research efforts in privacy-friendly analytics
using standard database technologies in recent years, the development of privacy concepts and secure
analytics solutions for knowledge graph data is still relatively unexplored. The main innovation of
CRYPTO4GRAPH-AI is to enable secure and efficient analytics on graph data by using state-of-the-art
semantic technologies, machine learning (ML) and cryptography. To this end, CRYPTO4GRAPH-AI will
leverage ML solutions, addressing issues such as data owner privacy, confidential data protection, data
sovereignty, efficient knowledge management, and scalability, accuracy, and federated analytics for
graph data.

The project consortium consists of two German partners who are experts in semantic and ML
technologies (research institute: Fraunhofer FIT, company: eccenca GmbH) and two French partners
specialized in "Privacy Enhancing Technologies'' (research institute: INRIA, company: Cosmian). The
project will enable knowledge exchange between the two countries and conduct interdisciplinary
research to develop new privacy-enhancing solutions for KGs.
